Features not implemented:
1. Button presses for selecting products. It is assumed that buttons pressed would corrrespond to products and the selected product is used directly for all purposes. 
2. Timeout concept for switching messages when display is checked after an interval. Instead a separate function is called after the relevant methods to update display.

Future improvements:
1. Code could be modularized better in terms of file structure or code components itself.
